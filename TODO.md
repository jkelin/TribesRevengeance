Things that need doing in no particular order:
==============================================

- [ ] Improve contact.md (there is not enough content there)
- [ ] Improve links.md (it's ugly and not aligned properly)
- [ ] Optimize bulma size (in main.scss link only to things being used)
- [ ] Consider using svg icons in favor of font awesome (because it is huge)
- [ ] Create system for adding tags to download links so that users know what is alive and what is missing
      - Dead links should display red tag
      - Alive links should display grey tag with filesize
- [ ] Create system (or use service or so...) that will automatically scan download links and check their alive/dead status, export this into txt so we know what still needs doing
