On this page you will find out how to enable the in game console. A must do, if you ask us!

  

In order to enable the console, you must follow these steps:

 1. **Find** or **create** a shortcut of your `TV_CD_DVD.exe`

NOTE: The `TV_CD_DVD.exe` is located in the `.../VUGames/Tribes Vengeance/Program/Bin` folder

 2. **Rightclick** the shortcut
 3. **Modify** the **target** field, by adding `-console` in the back (mind the whitespace)
  

So for example you get the following: `"C:\Program Files\VUGames\Tribes Vengeance\Program\Bin\TV\_CD\_DVD.exe" -console`

  

TIP: To enable both windowed mode, as console, you can add -console and -windowed to the target field. (mind the whitespaces!)

So for example you get the following: `"C:\Program Files\VUGames\Tribes Vengeance\Program\Bin\TV\_CD\_DVD.exe" -console -windowed`
