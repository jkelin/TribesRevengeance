## Open Source

This site is [fully open source and hosted on Github]({{ "https://github.com/" | append: site.github_username | append: "/" | append: site.github_repo }}). If you would like to contribute or have a resource that you would like to keep for future generations of Tribes players - feel free to open a pull request.

As such, it should be virtually impossible for it's content to get lost (like it happend to many of it's predecessors) because when it's current maintainer goes dark - anyone can pickup the torch again!
